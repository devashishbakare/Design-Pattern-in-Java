The Lighthouse Story
Imagine you live in a coastal village where ships constantly need guidance to navigate safely. A single lighthouse is built to light up the entire coast, ensuring that all ships can see it and avoid dangerous waters.
Why just one lighthouse?
Consistency: All ships rely on a single beacon of light, preventing confusion from multiple, conflicting signals.
Efficiency: Running one lighthouse saves resources compared to multiple ones.
Global Access: Everyone along the coast can see the lighthouse—it’s there for everyone to use without duplication.
In the same way, a Singleton is like a lighthouse for your program: one instance that everyone can access, guiding consistent behavior and saving resources.

The Time Square
In a village there is time clock on big building, everyone have access to same clock for there time
- All people are rely on single time clock
- Instead of buying a clock for each home, we have saved a lot of resources to efficiency is there
- Everyone access the clock meaning it's a global one

Application of the singleton pattern

In many applications, we need a single, consistent instance of a class that can be accessed globally. Examples include:
A database connection manager, where having multiple instances would waste resources.
A logging system, where you want one consistent log file to capture all events.
A configuration manager, where only one copy of configuration data should exist.

The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
