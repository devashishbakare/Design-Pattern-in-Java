When to Use the Bridge Pattern:

Complex Product Variations:
When you have many products (e.g., pizzas, cars, devices) and each product can have multiple variations (e.g., size, type, color, feature set).

Future Growth:
If you anticipate adding more products or variations in the future, the Bridge pattern allows for seamless extension without modifying existing code.

Separation of Concerns:
The Bridge pattern separates the abstraction (e.g., the product's main functionality) from the implementation (e.g., variations or additional features). This makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain.

Key Components of the Bridge Pattern:

Abstraction:
Represents the high-level concept (e.g., a product like Pizza or Device). It depends on the bridge (implementation interface) but doesn’t implement its details directly.

Implementor (Bridge):
Represents the variations or specifics (e.g., sizes of pizza, colors of devices). This is an interface or an abstract class.

Concrete Implementor:
Specific implementations of the bridge interface (e.g., Small, Medium, Large pizza sizes).

Refined Abstraction:
Variations of the product (e.g., Veg Pizza, Chicken Pizza). These rely on the bridge for specific details.

Why Use the Bridge Pattern?

Ease of Adding New Products or Variations:
You don’t need to rewrite or modify existing classes when introducing new products or variations.

Reduces Code Duplication:
Common logic is shared, and specifics are handled by the implementor classes.

Decouples Abstraction from Implementation:
The high-level product concept (e.g., Pizza) doesn’t need to know about specific details (e.g., sizes), which makes the code modular and flexible.

Example: Pizza Shop

Before Bridge:
Each combination of product and variation requires a new class (e.g., SmallVegPizza, MediumVegPizza, LargeVegPizza).
Adding a new product (e.g., Cheese Pizza) or a new variation (e.g., Extra Large) is cumbersome.

After Bridge:
Product (e.g., Pizza) and Variation (e.g., Size) are decoupled.
Adding a new product or variation becomes as simple as implementing a new abstraction or implementor class.

In Real Life:
Pizza Shop: Products (Veg, Chicken, Cheese) and Variations (Small, Medium, Large).
Car Manufacturing: Products (Sedan, SUV, Hatchback) and Variations (Fuel Type, Color).
UI Framework: Components (Button, Dropdown, Modal) and Variations (Light Theme, Dark Theme).
Devices: Products (Smartphones, Laptops) and Variations (OS: Android, iOS, Windows).

Decision-Making for Using Bridge:
If you expect more variations in the future → Use Bridge.
If the relationship between products and variations is static or minimal, other simpler patterns might work.
