Chain of Responsibility:
The Chain of Responsibility Pattern allows a request to pass through a chain of handlers. Each handler can process the request or pass it along the chain. It decouples the sender of the request from its receivers.

When to Use the Chain of Responsibility Pattern?
-Dynamic Request Handling: When you want multiple objects to handle a request but without hardcoding the handler's sequence.
-Avoid Long Conditionals: Instead of writing lengthy if-else or switch blocks.
-Flexible and Scalable: When you need a system where responsibilities can easily be added or changed.

Real-World Example: Customer Support System
Imagine a customer support system where requests can be handled by a Level 1 Agent, escalated to a Level 2 Agent, and, if unresolved, sent to a Manager.

### **1. Logging Frameworks**
- **Application**: Logging libraries (e.g., Log4j, SLF4J) use this pattern to pass log messages through a chain of loggers (e.g., console, file, remote server).
- **How It Works**:
  - A `Logger` object is configured with multiple logging levels (e.g., INFO, DEBUG, ERROR).
  - If the message is of severity `ERROR`, it is handled by the `ERROR` logger. Otherwise, it is passed down to a less severe handler like `INFO` or `DEBUG`.

---

### **2. Authentication and Authorization in Web Applications**
- **Application**: Middleware in web frameworks (e.g., Express.js, Django) often follows the CoR pattern.
- **How It Works**:
  - Each middleware layer checks part of the request (e.g., authentication, permissions, rate limiting).
  - If the layer cannot handle the request, it passes the request to the next middleware.

---

### **3. Event Handling in GUIs**
- **Application**: User interfaces like those built with Java Swing or JavaScript use CoR for event propagation.
- **How It Works**:
  - A `click` or `keypress` event propagates through a chain of UI components.
  - The event is handled by the first component that can process it (e.g., a button), or it continues up the chain (e.g., from child to parent elements).

---

### **4. Customer Support Ticketing System**
- **Application**: Helpdesk software handles user complaints and issues.
- **How It Works**:
  - Requests (e.g., "reset password," "refund request") are passed through support levels (e.g., Level 1, Level 2, Level 3).
  - Each level decides whether it can handle the request or escalate it to the next level.

---

### **5. Request Validation**
- **Application**: Validation pipelines for data processing.
- **How It Works**:
  - A user input (e.g., form submission) passes through multiple validators:
    1. **Syntax validation** (e.g., email format).
    2. **Business rule validation** (e.g., age > 18).
    3. **Database validation** (e.g., username already exists).
  - If a validator cannot handle the request, it passes it to the next validator in the chain.

---

### **6. Transaction Processing in Payment Gateways**
- **Application**: Payment processing systems use CoR to handle transaction authorization and validation.
- **How It Works**:
  - A payment request goes through several steps: **fraud detection**, **credit card validation**, **balance check**, and **final approval**.
  - Each step in the chain either processes or rejects the transaction.

---

### **7. File Parsing**
- **Application**: Parsers for different file formats (e.g., text, CSV, XML, JSON).
- **How It Works**:
  - A file is passed through a chain of parsers.
  - Each parser checks if it can handle the file type. If not, it forwards the file to the next parser.

---

### **8. Spam Filtering in Email Systems**
- **Application**: Email systems like Gmail use CoR to filter incoming messages.
- **How It Works**:
  - Incoming emails pass through multiple filters:
    1. **Virus scan**.
    2. **Spam score check**.
    3. **Phishing detection**.
  - Each filter either handles the email or passes it to the next filter.

---

### **9. Workflow Management Systems**
- **Application**: Workflow engines (e.g., approval processes).
- **How It Works**:
  - A document (e.g., leave request) moves through multiple approval stages (e.g., manager, HR, finance).
  - Each stage decides to approve, reject, or escalate the request.

---

### **10. API Request Handlers**
- **Application**: Routing in APIs.
- **How It Works**:
  - An API request passes through a series of handlers:
    1. **Authentication**.
    2. **Authorization**.
    3. **Business logic**.
  - Each handler checks its responsibility and passes the request along if it doesnâ€™t handle it.

---

### **Key Benefits of Using CoR**
1. **Decoupling**: Handlers are independent of each other, making them reusable and easier to modify.
2. **Flexibility**: Handlers can be added, removed, or reordered without changing the client code.
3. **Responsibility Separation**: Each handler focuses on a specific task.

---

### **How to Recognize When to Use CoR**
- You need **multiple handlers** to process a request in a **specific sequence**.
- The request may or may not be processed by all handlers.
- You want to make the system **open for extension** (add more handlers easily) but **closed for modification** (no changes to existing code).
